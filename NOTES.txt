python and pip issues
    pip install didn't quite set up installing python-dotenv well
        Was able to fix it with python -m pip install python-dotenv
    >>Pretty sure it's that I have aliased python3 to python, but haven't done the same for pip
        It must have been downloading the package as pip not pip3
            Alias added
